# Cardboard
Fork of [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) that fixes nitpicks I have with Bukkit as a whole. 
Severe API breakages ahead, use with caution. **Do not** expect Bukkit, Spigot, or Paper plugins to work with this.

## How To (Server Admins)
If you don't know what you're doing and just want to run a server like normal, **do not** use Cardboard.

Just like with Paper, just download and run Cardboard as a normal jar file.

You can download Cardboard from [the releases page](https://github.com/ItsTehBrian/Cardboard/releases), or [build it yourself](#how-to-compiling-jar-from-source)

## How To (Plugin Developers)
See our API patches [here](https://github.com/ItsTehBrian/Cardboard/tree/master/patches/api).
